"SecureNet Command Center," a sophisticated dashboard for security and network operations.

Architecture:

Frontend: It's a React single-page application built with Vite and TypeScript.
Backend: It's set up to use Supabase for database and authentication.
UI: The interface is built with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui components, featuring rich data visualizations.
Current Status: The application is a high-fidelity prototype. The UI is well-developed, but the authentication and data are currently mocked. The Supabase integration is configured but not yet fully implemented.

In short, it's a comprehensive security dashboard prototype, ready for backend integration. Let me know if you'd like to dive into any specific part of the codebase.
